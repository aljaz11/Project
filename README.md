# Project

Go to the ``..\code`` directory and run (change ``python3`` or ``py`` according to your python version):

**macOS:**
``cat test.json | python3 main.py``
or
**windows:**
``py main.py < test.json``

### Tests
To run tests go to ``..\code`` directory and run (again you might have to change ``python3``):
``python3 -m unittest test.py -v``
